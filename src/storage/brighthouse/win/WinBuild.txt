Pre-Requisites:
You need to have installed on your computer 
1) CMake(www.cmake.org) 
2) VS 2005 or VS 2008 with all recent updates and service packs
3) Boost 1.34.0 or newer with pre-built debug and release libraries for respective VC++.
	(if you build for 32bit target you can simplify the process and use booostpro.com
	boost libraries installer.)
4) Put `junction' (http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896768.aspx) in your $PATH.

You can check out and build Infobright on Windows in any directory.
I use "C:\Temp\BH" just as an example.

1. Check out Infobright sources

     C:\Temp\trunk>svn co svn+ssh://SVNConnection/repo/BH/trunk c:\Temp\BH

3. Change the current directory

     cd C:\Temp\BH

4. Create file `_my_make' with following contents:
/* starts here */
boost_install_path="c:/Program Files/boost"
edition="enterprise";
target="release";
/* ends here */

Where `c:/Program Files/boost' is path to your boost installation directory,
`enterprise' is product type, release is requested target type.
Important: apostrophe and semicolon characters are important.

5. Run configuration script win-configure.js.

     C:\Temp\BH> win-configure.js

	(you can skip step 4. and specify parameters on command line:
     C:\Temp\BH> win-configure.js BOOST='c:/Program Files/boost' EDITION=enterprise TARGET=release
	)
6. Start Visual Studio

7. Make a fix in Boost include file to make it compatible with Infobright code.
    File: object_pool.hpp
    Fix:

#ifndef BOOST_NO_TEMPLATE_CV_REF_OVERLOADS
#   include <boost/pool/detail/pool_construct.inc>
#else
#   include <boost/pool/detail/pool_construct.inc>   // WINPORT
//#   include <boost/pool/detail/pool_construct_simple.inc>
#endif

8. Open and build Debug configuration for solution C:\Temp\BH\vendor\mysql_5_14\MySql.sln

9. If you have MySql installed in c:\mysql, you can run mysqld under VS IDE debugger.

      13.1. Set mysqld as a StartUp project for the MySql soltion

      13.2. Add "--basedir=c:/mysql --datadir=c:/mysql/data --console" 
            in mysqld's properties Debugging\Command Argruments.

    Push F5 and enjoy the ride.
